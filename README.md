# Slack
In the face of a global pandemic, more and more people have to adapt to the work/study from home lifestyle. With an increase in prolonged hours sitting in front of a desk, it is more important than ever for us to detect bad sitting posture and correct it before it results in long-term health implications. As such our team, NTUC Finest hope to solve this problem.

We predict proper posture with the use of a camera, TensorFlow and python and implemented on our application - Slack which is powered by Swift.

Running Run me.ipynb, convert the first two rows from markdown to code.
Under action_01, you can add your own datasets for good postures.
Under action_02, you can add your own datasets for bad postures.
Our provided samples should work just fine for a full-on side view of the body.
Number of photos for testing can vary but the python function will have to be altered in Line 97 range(15). Change 15 to your number of photos.

Our Slack app powered by Swift will feature a Pomodoro Timer for studying/ Working
It also will alert users when their posture “slacks”, indicating Bad Posture!!!
