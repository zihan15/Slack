# Slack
We predict proper posture with the use of a camera, TensorFlow and python and implemented on our application - Slack which is powered by Swift.

Running Run me.ipynb, convert the first two rows from markdown to code.
Under action_01, you can add your own datasets for good postures.
Under action_02, you can add your own datasets for bad postures.
Number of photos for testing can vary but the python function will have to be altered in Line 97 range(15). Change 15 to your number of photos.
